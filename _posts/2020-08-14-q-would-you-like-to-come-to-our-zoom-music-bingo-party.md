We’re reaching out to invite you to one of our upcoming events that you won’t want to miss: our Music Bingo Party on August 21 at 6:30 p.m.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[![](/uploads/rebecca.JPG){: width="182" height="65"}](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-music-bingo-rebecca-and-co-real-estate-group-tickets-115599696805?aff=efbeventtix&amp;fbclid=IwAR3I0urIQHpNIdu2dnXgy635Vm8E26Yi-_M2l2BN350j0QdhMAZPQNJDhZE){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

So how does a Music Bingo Party work? Well, we’ll have three Bingo cards, and the DJ will play some music from the 80s and 90s—if you have the song that is playing, you’ll market it down on your bingo card. When you get a bingo, you’ll win a prize\!

We’ll have three different games with three different prizes, including gift certificates to some of my favorite restaurants in town (you’ll love them, too\!). We’ll also have a drawing at the end of the night for those who didn’t get a chance to win during bingo. **You can be entered into that drawing in one of four ways:**

1. Register using the button above or below.
2. Just show up, have fun, and play bingo with us\!
3. Donate $20 or more to Pleasantview Industries, a local charity, to help those in need during this time of COVID.
4. If you’ve given us a real estate referral in the past eight months, you’ll get three entries\!
5. If you give us a referral between now until August 21, you’ll get five entries\!
