The market is hot right now and homes are selling quickly, but before I could tell you if I think it’s a good time for you to sell your home, I would first ask you a couple of questions so that I could better understand how to address your real estate needs.&nbsp;

First of all, were you already thinking of making a move this spring or summer? **We were deemed an essential service early on in the shutdown, so we’ve been working with plenty of buyers and sellers who truly needed to buy or sell a home.** At the onset of the health crisis, we adapted to work remotely and digitally as much as possible.&nbsp;

Here’s how I know the market is hoppin’ right now: The weekend prior to the recording of this video, I wrote an offer on a property that had 22 other offers on it\! If that’s not evidence enough, consider that **every listing I’ve taken and sold in the last 60 days went for above asking price.&nbsp;**

Next, I’d ask you what your time frame is, and whether you’ve already secured a place to move into. We’re still seeing an average period of 30 to 40 days for escrow, though, with regulations changing almost daily, some lenders may require extra time and paperwork from buyers. Sellers who enter the market should anticipate such delays.&nbsp;

The great thing about working with a team that sells a lot of homes is that we’re on top of these changes daily and always plan accordingly to get you where you need to be. Since we monitor the market every day and digest the numbers (how many new listings came on the market, how many went under contract, how many have come off the market without selling, etc.), **we’re in the best position to help you understand how your personal goals and time frame square with current market activity.&nbsp;**

So, if you’ve been considering buying or selling but you’re just not sure how to proceed in these uncertain times, we’re here to be a resource for you. We’re leveraging the latest technology in the form of virtual appointments, showings, and even open houses. There are so many ways we can get your home sold while minimizing health risks.&nbsp;

We’d love to be your real estate team of choice and show you what we can do to help you navigate the home selling or buying process safely and effectively in this hot market. Reach out to us via phone or email with any questions you may have. We look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;
